# Simpkin2k21
ok lads lets try bootstrap x

(aka making our own theme for funsies... but not really, just cba with wordpress you know what i mean i just wanna be me)

# The Plan:
shanesimpkin.co.uk runs of Wordpress, which is useful for the style of website I wish to have - but, creating an actual one-page portfolio/home site is not only a lot easier to manage by having less clutter, it also eats up less server space that I don't need to use.
